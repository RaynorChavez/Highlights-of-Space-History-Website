                What separates STEM from the usual Math and Science education is the use of Blended Learning approach. It helps the student learn computational thinking skills which focuses on the real world applications of problem solving.

                DLSU uses the Blended Learning approach to the education of their students bridging the gap between the traditional mode of teaching writing and the pedagogical potentials of technology integration in the language classroom. STEM students in DLSU will not just stay in the classrooms and listen to their professors all day long. The students are immersed to the actual environment and are taught using various interactional methods. The students are subjected to activities like Group reports, panel discussions, seminars and many other activities.
