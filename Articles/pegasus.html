               Pegasus 1 or I, known before launch as Pegasus A, was an American satellite which was launched in 1965 to study micrometeoroid impacts in low Earth orbit. It was the first of three Pegasus satellites to be launched. The Pegasus spacecraft were manufactured by Fairchild Hiller, and operated by NASA.

                Pegasus 1 was a Pegasus satellite, consisting of 1,450 kilograms (3,200 lb) of instruments, attached to the S-IV upper stage of the carrier rocket which had placed it into orbit. It had a total mass of 10,297 kilograms (22,701 lb), and was equipped with two sets of micrometeoroid detection panels, and a radio for tracking and returning data.  The panels were 29 meters (95 ft) long, and equipped with 116 individual detectors.
