                As technology progresses, there is more and more demand for improvement which may come in the form of better engines, better batteries, or better traveling. NASA’s Kennedy Space Center has decided to partner up with several other organizations to research and conduct experiments to find a solution to the inconvenient sonic boom.

                A “sonic boom”, as defined by NASA, is “the thunder-like noise a person on the ground hears when an aircraft or other type of aerospace vehicle flies overhead faster than the speed of sound or supersonic.” Usually, sonic booms only occur near launch areas and can be heard as far as 1 mile away, depending on the circumstances of the launch and the parameters of the environment. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                If a method to reduce or to completely eradicate sonic booms when a spaceship is jet launched, then it will change and improve air transportation. More advanced models of airplanes and jets do incur sonic booms and this usually poses a problem for neighboring residential areas, which usually results in a quarrel between launch organizations and residents.
