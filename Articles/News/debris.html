                Over half a million pieces of space debris currently orbit the earth, and this poses a serious problem for functional satellites and future launches. There have already been cases in which orbiting debris have collided with satellites and this not only costs millions of dollars in damage it also cuts of communication with the satellite depending on how big the damage. Unfortunately, conventional robot hands that can be found in most space stations are not capable for large, smooth pieces of floating debris and other methods such as using suction cups or a strong adhesive do not apply to the situation due to the lack of matter in space.

                Recently, scientists have been observing the gecko, how it is able scale vertical walls without having to secrete a type of adhesive. The toes of a gecko are covered in hundreds of bristles that generate a kind of electric forge strong enough to stick onto a surface. Scientists have already patterned a prototype this way and have tested it against floating pieces of debris and were able to successfully grab onto various shapes such as cubes, cylinders, and spheres without much distress so that when released the objects barely move.

                <p>
                This kind of technology, if possibly made large scale, could potentially divert problems caused by debris as well as removing space pollution from the outskirts of the earthâ€™s atmosphere.
