                It is important for the pilots of a spacecraft to stay calm in any situation and to maintain their vitals so that nothing sudden occurs that would greatly affect the mission. The Advance Textile’s Research Group is currently exploring the different types of smart textiles so that it would be much more efficient to measure the vital signs of aircraft pilots by incorporating the pieces of textiles into the normal clothes of the pilots.

               The new textiles will be developed to monitor various indicators of stress, including a variable heart rate, perspiration and body temperature. Multiple sensors will be embedded into the yarns used to make clothing and textiles. The textiles will be able to monitor heart rates through an electrocardiogram sensor system, making it possible to check fatigue and tell when a pilot is losing attentiveness.

                The leader of this research team said: “This will enable the collection of data which will indicate the psychological experiences a pilot goes through while navigating a plane, potentially through unknown situations.”
                </p>
                
                <p>Another lead researcher said: “By monitoring a pilot’s mental state while testing any new technologies in a simulator, a better understanding can be developed of how these technologies can be integrated into a cockpit.”</p>
