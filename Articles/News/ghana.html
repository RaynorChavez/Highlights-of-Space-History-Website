               Ghanasat-1, the first ever satellite developed in Ghana, has successfully been deployed into orbit from the International Space Station. The unit was developed by a group of students at All Nations University College in Koforidua, Ghana, and will be controlled from the campus’ ground station.

             Its cameras will aid the country to monitor its coastal regions as well as improve their capacity in the field of space technology. Japan Aerospace Exploration Angency’s Tsubaka Space Centre will monitor the satellite with the help of their Japanese ambassador in Ghana, Sylvester Parker Allotey.

               Not only is this a big step for the country, it will also help them in further developing their economy especially in terms of technology and exploration, giving them more information from high above and especially warning them on upcoming news about their coastal areas.
