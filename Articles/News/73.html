                The Soyuz-2.1a lifted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome at 2:36 a.m. Eastern. The rocket deployed the primary payload, the Kanopus-V-IK remote sensing satellite, about an hour after launch, followed by 72 smallsat secondary payloads over the next seven hours.

                <p>
               The launch was the largest number of satellites flown on a single Russian rocket, and the second most on any single launch after the February launch of an Indian Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle carrying 104 satellites. The launch was particularly complex in that it involved several maneuvers by the Fregat upper stage to deploy the satellites in three orbits. Kanopus-V-IK was released into an orbit at about 500 kilometers.

                <p>
                Glavkosmos, which arranged the launch of the secondary payloads, is now working on a second such launch, scheduled for late this year from the Vostochny Cosmodrome in Russiaâ€™s Far East. That launch, Kryukovskiy said, will carry about 40 smallsats, but he said confidentiality agreements prevented him from disclosing the names of the customers at this time.
