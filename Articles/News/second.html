                A SpaceX capsule was the first of its kind to return to earth from space for a second time. Until now, no single cargo capsule has visited the ISS and returned to Earth more than once.  In fact, all other non-SpaceX vehicles that visit the space station are designed to burn up in the atmosphere after a single flight. SpaceX has been collecting the leftover debris from returned dragon capsules but only recently has one been successfully reused. Elon Musk has spent the last 15 years on the idea to make space vehicles reusable. SpaceX has even begun reusing its Falcon 9 rockets for the past year.

              The veteran Dragon capsule splashed down in the Pacific Ocean shortly after 5:10 a.m. PT Monday. The craft is loaded with samples, gear and other parts of various scientific experiments performed on the ISS that will now be further analyzed on Earth. The robotic Dragon's mission was a fairly routine cargo ferrying assignment to and from the International Space Station, but making the relatively mundane trip twice is historic.
